## Overview

Creating an expense card with a chart that is resposive with data from a json file.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

- Develop JavaScript functionality for dynamic loading of bars on chart from json file
- Still in progress for completion -08/26

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [Chart.js](https://chartjs.org/)

### What I learned

Using Async/Await with try/catch block pushed me to slow down access my code and review. Researching and using Chart.js library for the first time. Just attempting and reading and attempting again was the best thing for me to do to make sure I was understanding the material. And there is still plenty for me to learn about Chart.js so I am excited to use it in other applications because I do love data visualization.

### Continued development

- Complete CSS
- Complete HTML
- Review JavaScript for repetitive code
- Use with API for data
- Switch to React
